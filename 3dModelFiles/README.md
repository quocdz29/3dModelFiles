# 3dModelFiles

A simple library that parses 3MF and STL (both ASCII and Binary) 3D model file formats to a common data type, from which a MeshGeometry3D, GeometryModel3D, XAML markup code or a collection of Triangle3D can ber obtained.
Comes with tests to ensure correctness.

The STLFile class and 3MFFile class are modular and have the same interface.
